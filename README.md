BayesAdaptive: Bayesian response-adaptive designs for multi-arm sequential clinical trials
==========================================================================================

The `BayesAdaptive` package was written by Steffen Ventz and is available from [Steffen Ventz R Packages](http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu/~steffen/software.html).

This repository starts with `BayesAdaptive` version 1.0 and implements some tweaks to adapt it to current `R version 3.3.3`.

Installation
------------

The `BayesAdaptive` package can be installed from GitHub as follows:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "stefvanbuuren/BayesAdaptive")
```

More information
----------------

The package contains a vignette that demonstrates the functionality. Also, see the paper by Ventz et.al. (Ventz et al. 2017).
